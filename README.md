### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

- 📖 I’m currently learning Javascript, Node and various Discord JS libraries.

- ✍️ I’m currently working on two JS Discord bots: "Vibrations" (music), and "Untold" (utility & text to speech).
Both of these bots are currently being hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3b+, and are used in a private server. I am planning on building a small cluster of Raspberry Pi's to improve performance, and expand hosting capability and perhaps allow other users to invite them to their own servers in the future.

- 💬 Ask me about: Will add stuff here later.

- 📫 How to reach me: Will update info here later.

The world is a strange place, these days. Be safe, and be good to one another. ✌️
