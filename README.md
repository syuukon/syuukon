### Hello! Welcome to my profile.

- 📖 I’m currently creating automation code (written in Javascript) for the game Adventure Land (Code MMO) - https://adventure.land
This game is incredibly fun and I have already learnt a great deal from playing it. The game is based on creating your own character automation (which is encouraged by the dev) in an MMO style world. If you are learning Javascript and are interested in learning how to optimise your code, or basic automation in general, this is a great place to do it. Their Discord server is very active and incredibly helpful in learning how to interact with, and optimise, the API and the automation of the game. I have explored the basics of a finite state machine and am planning on learning how to implement behaviour trees, with the aim of combining the two methods in the near future.

- ✍️ I’ve worked on two of my own JS Discord bots: "Vibrations" (audio), and "Untold" (utility & text to speech).
Both of these bots were being hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3b+, and were used in a private server. I am planning on building a small cluster of Raspberry Pi's to improve performance, and expand hosting capability and perhaps allow other users to invite them to their own servers in the future. (These bots are currently offline, pending upgrades / optimisation, but will eventually be enhanced and brought back online in the future.

- 💬 Ask me about: Adventure Land, Discord bots (Javascript), MMO games and music.

- 📫 How to reach me: Will update info here later.

The world is a strange place these days. Be safe, and be good to one another. Have a great day! ✌️
